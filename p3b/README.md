# CS 537 Project 3B: Analyzing xv6 Locks and Conditions

Project description can be found [here](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2021/Projects/p3b.html)

There is no design and implementation involved in this assignment. The goal is to analyze behavior of two lock instances and two processes that sleep and then wakeup and document everything. Everything can be found in `p3b.pdf`
